Such conditions include e.g. milk fever, various limb problems and lameness. The product has beneficial effects also in animals with reproductive disturbances (reduced fertility, disturbances of spermatogenesis) and in those with diseases of the skin and hair coat.In pigs, CaPhos Pro is recommended for the prevention and treatment of peripartal problems such as difficult farrowing and MMA syndrome, for supporting the maturation of gametes (ova and spermatozoa) and for the prevention and treatment of various limb problems and lameness.In laying hens, the product is recommended for use mainly at the peak of egg production and when eggshell formation and other production disturbances occur.
